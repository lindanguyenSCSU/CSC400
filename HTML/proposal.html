			<h1>Hotel Reservation - Vtrip</h1>
			<h3>Motivation. </h3>
			<p>People all over the world are fond of travel and tourism. People often find it difficult to search for the best places. To address the issue , we adopt the travelling website which will offer the best places among others.
Hotels are much larger now with most of the people going online, searching deep for information about where they want to stay, facility and pricing all together will create a business opportunity for owners to attract more visitors. 
Especially, during pandemic time, most people would choose the option of booking and checking online which will save a lot of time and it is a good idea for safety issues too, so online would be the best solution for this situation. 
This project is based on how an effective travel website will make us feel. 
It is based on a travelling website with fully featured functions that will activate the travelling bug with vibrant imagery. 
This website contains highlights of some important places along with high quality photography and allows people to book their dream destination within their budgets.</p>
